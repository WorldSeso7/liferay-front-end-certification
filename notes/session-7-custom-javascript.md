# Session 7. JavaScript

The `main.js` is the primary JavaScript file packaged in the theme.

In the `main.js` we can require other JavaScript files.

[jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Metal.js](https://metaljs.com/) and [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) are pre-loaded.

Interesting events are:

AUI().ready(callback)
Liferay.Portlet.ready(callback)
Liferay.on (callback)
