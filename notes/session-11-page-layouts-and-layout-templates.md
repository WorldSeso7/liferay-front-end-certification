# Session 11. Page Layouts and Layout Templates

Allow to arrange content and applications on the page.

There are several layouts out-of-the-box in Liferay, for instance" 1 Column, 2 Columns, etc.

These layouts are based on Bootstrap CSS framework (12-column based).

Widgets can be embedded into layouts.

## Create a layout

We can use the `liferay-theme-generator` with `Yeoman`.

```
yo liferay-theme:layout
```
