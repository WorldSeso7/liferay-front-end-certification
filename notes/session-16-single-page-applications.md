# Session 16. Single Page Applications

SPAs dynamically update a single HTML page as user interacts with a site.

SPA features are enabled in Liferay by default.

The Liferay's engine is **[Senna.js](https://sennajs.com/)**; it is on charge of loading content dynamically via AJAX calls.

**Configuration options for SPA in Liferay**

- Cache Expiration time (minutes)
- Navigation Exception Selectors
- Request Timeout Time
- User Notification Time (milliseconds)
