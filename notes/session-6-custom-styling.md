# Session 6. Custom Styling

We have to use **SASS/SCSS**. With the benefit of being able to write CSS3.

- Variables
- Mixins. Group CSS declarations for re-using
- Inheritance. Share properties among selectors
- Nesting. Create hierarchies 
- Operators. Possible to run math operations

## Global styling

`_custom.scss` for global styling (margins, padding).

This is going to be our "main" file to make modifications by using SASS partials.


## Partials in SASS 

We will use **partials** (their names start with underscore and should not be used independently).

`_clay_custom.scss` is an example of a partial.


## Bourbon

Mixin library to avoid re-writing CSS3 mixins.
