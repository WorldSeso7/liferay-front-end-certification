# Session 8. Configuring the theme

`liferay-look-and-feel.xml` is the file where we can add configurations for our theme. 
This file can include:

## Theme settings.

- **configurable:** can be changed by administrators?
- **key:** how we can get the value
- **type:** what kind of field we want (checkbox, select)
- **options:** in case we set a type select (comma separate list)
- **value:** sets the default value

## Application decorators

Example of decorators are portlet decorators.

## Color scheme

## Bundled layout themes


Add folder *layoutfpl* (with the source file and a thumbnail).
