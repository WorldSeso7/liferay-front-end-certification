# Session 19. Best Practices for Front-end

- It is recommended to build from the `styled` theme (it will include Clay components).
- portal_normal.ftl should kept uncluttered.
- `custom.scss` should be used for global styling changes
- `main.js` only global javascript
- Try to only include image sprite/maps and use CSS to place them
- Use `sitemap.json` when configuring the theme instead of using `LAR` files.
- Keep things modules for source files and htemes
- Remember there are SASS syntax, variables and Bourboun mixins
- Use JavaScript frameworks when needed (as Metal.js)
- Add theme settings and colors schemes to give administrator more decision power
