# Front-end Development in Liferay

This are just my personal notes for the [Liferay Front-end Certification](https://www.liferay.com/services/certification/dxp/front-end-developer) program,
officially known as [Liferay DXP Certified Professional Front-End Developer](https://www.liferay.com/services/certification/dxp/front-end-developer).

## What is this certification about?

This certification consists in:

- **Duration**: 90 minutes
- **Number of questions**: 50
- **Passing score**: 80%

My intention is not to replace the official [Liferay courses](https://university.liferay.com/) but to provide a summary of what my colleagues and I have learned
during our multiple implementations with several clients. 

This documentation also includes some personal comments and things I have experimented with.
